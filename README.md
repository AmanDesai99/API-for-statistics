Explanation,

We define a schema for the Transactions collection with an additional isSold field to indicate whether the item was sold or not.
We create an API endpoint /statistics/:year/:month that takes the year and month as parameters.
We use the aggregate method to calculate the total sale amount for the selected month. We filter the transactions to only include those within the selected month and with isSold set to true. We then group the results and calculate the sum of the saleAmount field.
We use the countDocuments method to count the total number of sold items and not sold items for the selected month.
We return the statistics in the response.

Example usage,

To get the statistics for January 2022: GET /statistics/2022/1
Note that this implementation assumes that the dateOfSale field is in the format YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ and that the isSold field is a boolean indicating whether the item was sold or not. You may need to adjust the schema and query accordingly based on your actual data structure.
